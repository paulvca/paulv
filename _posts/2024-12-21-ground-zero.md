Have you ever felt ashamed when you tried to write something you thought you knew, only to realize you didn't?  I've felt the same way. That's why I created this blog. 

One of the worst things we can have is the illusion of knowledge. We might think we know the subject just because we thought on it, or know what is the best decision to make after spending some time evaluating options. 

None of these are true unless we put our thoughts into words. Writing is the tool to turn the imaginary into reality. You can't outsource your critical thinking and if so, you're only setting yourself up to failure. Don't fall for this trap. 

Writing is important than ever in our age, where AI is evolving quickly and intelligence is now becoming a commodity. As Paul Graham notes

>*"I'm usually reluctant to make predictions about technology, but I feel fairly confident about this one: in a couple decades there won't be many people who can write.[...] The reason so many people have trouble writing is that it's fundamentally difficult. To write well you have to think clearly, and thinking clearly is hard. [...]  AI has blown this world open. Almost all pressure to write has dissipated. You can have AI do it for you, both in school and at work."*

Paul Graham, [Writes and Write-Nots](https://www.paulgraham.com/writes.html)

While the Future remains uncertain, I'm betting that those who have the ability to think clearly will have the greatest advantage. 

With that in mind, this blog won't be focused on only subject or area, as I don't like to limit myself. You'll see themes ranging from AI to music, Anime to literature, and so on. 

If you're willing to read along, then welcome. Your presence will be appreciated.
